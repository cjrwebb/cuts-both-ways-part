# Explaining away?

* A common response to these two pieces of evidence is that .green[ethnic inequalities] (associated with race and racism) and .green[socioeconomic inequalities] (associated with poverty and class) .green[are the same thing], and could therefore be tackled under policy and practice changes that tackle one or the other.

--

* Undoubtedly, racialised exposure to poverty plays a role, however it is not as simple as this. 

--

* Many ethnic groups that are disproportionately over-represented in care statistics on average are .green[actually disproportionately under-represented in high deprivation neighbourhoods and over-represented in low-deprivation neighbourhoods]. So poverty only goes so far in explaining ethnic disparity.

--

* This would mean that the graph we saw earlier, showing the ten deciles of deprivation as a social gradient, would look very different depending on the ethnic population.

--

* However, that is a lot of complexity. In order to describe it better, .green[we came up with a one-number way to measure the size of the social gradient] and .green[test how large or small it was between different ethnic populations].


???

Most common explanation: poverty and ethnicity are reflecting the same thing, however, need for an intersectional approach

The .green[social gradient] is a simple .green[measure of the size of socioeconomic inequalities in child welfare interventions]. You can think of it like a seesaw - .green[the stronger the social gradient is, the greater the vertical distance there is between the left and right sides of the seesaw].

The .green[social gradient] is a simple .green[measure of the size of socioeconomic inequalities in child welfare interventions]. You can think of it like a seesaw - .green[the stronger the social gradient is, the greater the vertical distance there is between the left and right sides of the seesaw]. 

In this case, the .green[left] of the seesaw represents .green[low deprivation neighbourhoods] and the .green[right] represents .green[high deprivation neighbourhoods] - with middle deprivation neighbourhoods in the middle. 

The steeper the incline of the seesaw, the more socioeconomic inequalities there are.

The .green[size of this incline or decline can be expressed in a single number] by measuring .green[how many times higher the height at the average deprivation level of the seesaw is than the height at the low-deprivation level of the seesaw].

On average, in neighbourhoods in a representative sample from England, the .green[size of the social gradient in children looked-after rates is 1.7].

On average, in neighbourhoods in a representative sample from England, the .green[size of the social gradient in children looked-after rates is 1.7]. 

This means that we estimate that there are, on average, 1.7 times higher children looked after rates in your average middle-deprivation neighbourhood than there are in your average low deprivation neighbourhood.

This is a valuable way of simplifying the social gradient, because .green[it holds for every comparison of the same 'distance' in deprivation]. 

For example, we would also expect the rates of children looked-after in your average high deprivation neighbourhood to be 1.7 times higher than the average middle deprivation neighbourhood.

The social gradient for the .green[White British] MSOA child populations in the representative CWIP sample was .green[around 3.9] - much larger than the social gradient for the entire population on average.

By contrast, the social gradient for the .green[Black African] MSOA child populations was .green[around 1.14], which was not statistically significant. This means that the .green[intervention rates did not differ significantly as deprivation increased].

In .green[low deprivation] MSOAs, .green[Black African] children's care rates outnumber .green[White British] children's by .green[4 to 1]. In .green[high deprivation] MSOAs, .green[White British] children's care rates outnumber .green[Black African] children's care rates by nearly .green[3 to 1].

This is why we describe the the .green[intersection of deprivation and ethnicity], or race and class, as an intersection that .green[cuts both ways] (Newitz & Wray, 1996).

Why does .green[White British identity] combined with .green[socioeconomic privilege] act as a .green[protective factor against child being taken into care], but White British identity combined with low socioeconomic status result in such massive leaps in intervention?

Why do .green[Black African] children have such .green[similar rates of intervention along the entire socioeconomic spectrum]? Why does deprivation not have a similar relationship for the Black African child population?

The last slide I want to show in this level of granularity is about the .red['Mixed Heritage (Other)' child population].

Across the spectrum of deprivation, the 'Mixed Heritage (Other)' population has .red[significantly higher rates of being in care], and a .red[significant social gradient]. They face the sharp end of the racial inequalities and socioeconomic inequalities we see in child welfare interventions.

Mixed Heritage people are the .red[fastest growing ethnic population in the UK]. Yet our analyses rarely consider the inequalities they face - .red[they are often excluded] from analyses because the category is so broad.

.green[Mixed Heritage] people in the CSEW are around .green[1.46 times more likely than White British] people to report that they experienced emotional, physical, and/or sexual abuse or witnessed domestic violence or .green[abuse in the home]. Mixed Heritage children are .green[1.55 times more likely to be living in care].

For .green[Mixed Heritage] and .green[Asian] children, .green[different exposure to abuse] as reported in adulthood can only tell .green[part of the story].

For .green[Black] children, self-reported .green[exposure to abuse] in childhood is totally .green[out of step with disproportionate intervention]. Black adults are less likely to report childhood abuse but Black children are more likely to be in care.

The disproportionality between .green[intervention and experience] is likely to be .green[even starker in an intersectional analysis]. A system and service-side response is necessary.

# Consequences for Policy and Practice

* .green[Failing to develop the infrastructure to identify and act on intersectional inequalities risks exacerbating ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities]. For example, the assumption that anti-racist practice/policy will reduce ethnic disproportionality because of the strong association between poverty and race is probably incorrect.

--

* .green[The data required to conduct intersectional analyses is poor, largely because it precludes individual-level models]. As we already saw in this case, introducing more complex intersections is likely to change our understanding of child welfare inequalities further. 

--

* .green[We need a better understanding of the mechanisms of intersectional child welfare inequalities by thinking about systemic issues outside of social work]. This includes thinking about how parent/childhood and socioeconomic status are racialised in: culture; law; education; policing; early help; health; medicine.


???

Consequences for policy and practice: we need to approach a new understanding of mechanisms using an intersectional approach
